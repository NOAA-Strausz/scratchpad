Gnuplot Tips


Here's a simple one liner:
To make a basic plot of a csv file.  This one plots the 4th column.
gnuplot -p -e "plot \"file.csv\" using 4 with lines"



For more complicated things you can start gnuplot and run a few quick commands.
For redhat, the system gnuplot is and older version 4.x.  Using miniconda's version,
which is 5.x gets better results.  Only problem is that it defaults to the qt terminal, which
doesn't appear to work.  So first set the terminal to x11 or whatever you want.
set terminal
the above shows what terminals are available
set terminal x11
this sets the termial to x11, which works well

Here's an example for plotting a Wetlabs Triplet's data in 3 plots:
First set date format for first column:
set xdata time
set timefmt "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S"
plot '18ckp2a_bbfl2wb_1307_39.25m.txt' using 1:(.0516*($4-50)) with lines
plot '18ckp2a_bbfl2wb_1307_39.25m.txt' using 1:(.0186*($6-54)) with lines
plot '18ckp2a_bbfl2wb_1307_39.25m.txt' using 1:(.0864*($8-48)) with lines

This plots turbidity, chlorophyll, and cdom in separate plots.  Note how calibration
equation is applied to the columns.


If spikes make range too big, you can set the range like this:

set yrange [0:20]

you can also set the xrange:

set xrange ["07/1/18 00:00:00":"07/2/19 12:00:00"]

You can use only date also.

set xrange ["08/1/18":"05/1/19"]

set title with following

set title "example" 

can put at end of plot

to make a few plots on the same chart, do something like the following:

plot '18ckp1a_sbe16_6592_39.cnv' skip 436 using 6 with lines title "18ckp1a",'18ckp2a_sbe16_6826_39.25m_3600.edit.cnv' skip 150 using 9 with lines title "18ckp2a", '18ckp3a_sbe16_6902_42.25m.cnv' skip 150 using 9 with lines title "18ckp3a", '18ckp4a_sbe16_6627_44.5m.cnv' skip 432 using 6 with lines title "18ckp4a", '18ckp5a_sbe16_6628_39.cnv' skip 432 using 6 with lines title "18ckp5a"

Some tips on plotting SBE-39s or 37s:

The date and time span two lines for these instruments, but that is not a problem
you can do something like this:

set timefmt " %d %b %Y, %H:%M:%S"

now you can plot:

plot '18bs4b_sbe37_3770_55m.asc' skip 61 using 5:4 with lines notitle

So the 5:4 means use column 5 for x, and 4 for y.  Column 5 is where the date
starts.  The formatting of the x axis might be unlegible, so you can format it
with something like this:

set format x "%m/%Y"

That will just do the month and the full year.  

Remember that 'skip' skips the big header that is in most seabird files, in this 
case the first 61 lines.  

for something like an sbe56 which has time as seconds since 2000, you can plot via the following:

plot 'SBE05604621_2020-10-09.cnv' skip 86 using ($1+946684800):2

946684800 is the amount of seconds from jan 1 1970 to jan 1 2000.  Since %s is from 1970 you need to add
the seconds.  FYI
